## Call for Papers: Workshop on Measurements, Attacks, and Defenses for the Web
(MADWeb) 2022

The web connects billions of devices, running a plethora of clients, and serves
billions of users every day. To cope with such a widespread adoption, the web
constantly changes. This is evident by some browsers that have a release cycle
of just six weeks. These rapid changes are not always studied from a security
perspective, resulting in new attack vectors that were never observed before.

The proposed workshop aims to attract researchers that work on the intersection
of browser evolution and web security. Our goal is to create and sustain a new
venue for discussing the rapid changes to browsers from a security perspective,
the security implications of current web technologies, how we can protect users
now, and make browsers in the future more secure without hindering the evolution
of the web.

## Workshop Format

MADWeb will be co-located with NDSS 2022 and will follow the same format as the
main conference.

One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the
workshop. The format will be traditional conference-style research presentations
with questions from the audience. Interactive and engaging presentations are
welcomed. Following notification to authors, more information will be provided
regarding speaking times and other details.

The accepted papers will be made available on the workshop website and the
workshop will have official proceedings. Publication in the proceedings is not
mandatory and authors can choose to have their papers excluded from the official
proceedings by selecting "No proceedings" during submission in HotCRP.


## Financial Support

MADWeb will provide limited financial support to a selected number of speakers
and attendees to pay workshop registration fees. Priority will be given to
authors of accepted papers, students working in relevant areas of research and
coming from under-represented institutions, attendees who have clear financial
need, attendees from diverse backgrounds and from under-represented minority
communities.

Please add any relevant information under "Request financial support for
attending the workshop?" to your submission in HotCRP, or contact the PC chairs
