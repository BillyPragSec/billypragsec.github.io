## Workshop on Active Defense and Deception
The AD&D workshop aims at promoting Active Defense as an effective extra security layer, with the goals of moving the
research forward and of encouraging its adoption by the industry. In particular, as the 'assume breach' mindset becomes the
norm, Active Defenses are becoming one of the most promising solutions.

Traditionally, information security distinguishes the roles of the attacker and the defender. The attacker is active: he gathers
information, explores the system, finds vulnerabilities, and executes exploits; while the defender is passive: he collects and
monitors the system logs and tries to detect malicious behavior via attack signatures. The attacker knows very well who the
victim is, while the defender often has limited information about the attackers, their methods, and their real motivations.
This imbalance makes more difficult to defend computer systems and helps the attackers to remain undetected for long
periods of time (today it takes on average 40+ days to reveal an attack [*]).

**Active defense** can mitigate these problems by finding ways to proactively engage with the attackers during the early stages
of the attack lifecycle. This can be implemented in various ways, such as by mutating/diversifying the system (i.e, Moving
Target Defense), adapting to the attacks in real time (Adaptive defense), and by introducing runtime defenses (e.g., RASP).
One important aspect of active defense is **deception**, where the defender can place enticing traps around the system, mimic
vulnerabilities, or obfuscate system elements to deceive, confuse, and mislead possible attackers. Since some of the most
destructive attacks (such as supply-chain attacks and phishing campaigns) are composed of multiple stages, active defense
has the potential to detect such attacks with rather simple techniques.

Despite the high accuracy promised by these techniques, active defense has not been widely adopted in information security.
Possible reasons include the fact that it requires a multidisciplinary approach and a good understanding of the human aspectand the psychology of the attackers, that its effectiveness is hard to quantify, and that it may be difficult to integrate active
defense at different layers in the target system.

Thus, this workshop aims to bring together researchers from a variety of fields such as psychology and cognitive science,
with experts in different forms of deception for defense, but also in offense techniques (such as social engineering and
disinformation). In particular, we aim to address the following questions:

- How can we evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of active defense?
- What is the impact of attackers’ deception awareness?
- How can we impact the attackers’ decision making process to make them waste more resources?
- Is it possible to reuse offensive deception techniques against attackers?
- How can we optimize the enticement of deceptive elements without making them too obvious?
- How can deceptive elements be updated to ensure long-term effectiveness?
- What are the myths vs. real world experiences on active defense?
- How can we move forward to increase the adoption of active defense?

## Call for contributions
AD&D workshop accepts three types of contributions:

* _Research Papers_: Traditional research papers with novel contributions, must be no longer than five pages, including all figures.
References and appendices will not count towards this limit, but reviewers are not required to read the appendices. Submissions must
be anonymized.

* _Research Proposals_: Single page proposals describing research ideas. A proposal should consist of a title, abstract, and brief
motivation for and description of the idea. Proposals can describe an ongoing research in various stages, or a novel idea or challenge.
The aim is to allow the authors to refine their ideas via the feedback from the workshop audience, to stimulate more research ideas,
and to encourage collaborations. Submitted proposals must be no longer than one page in double column format, including all figures.
References and appendices will not count towards this limit, but reviewers are not required to read the appendices. Proposals do not
need to include proof-of-concept or preliminary results. Submissions must be anonymized.


* _Presentation of previously accepted papers_: Authors of previously accepted papers (that are of interest to the workshop) can resubmit
their papers to be able to present them in the workshop. For such contributions, there is no page limitation on the submission, and
anonymization is not necessary. 

The Program Committee will evaluate the submissions based on relevancy, impact, and the potential to spark discussion at the workshop.
Interdisciplinary work is appreciated and encouraged.

### Areas of Interest
The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* All types of active defense methods: moving target defense, dynamic and runtime defenses, and deception use cases
* Attacker engagement in different stages of attack lifecycle
* Measuring the overhead of active defense
* Experiment designs and frameworks to measure the effectiveness of active defense
* Feedback from real-world uses of active defense, canaries, honeypots: What worked and what did not?
* Automation of active defense and deception
* Monitoring, alerting, containment, and deceptive response strategies
* Ensuring longevity and continuation of deception
* Attackers' reasoning, decision making and behavior patterns
* Cognitive approaches that attackers can get prepared against
* Deceiving humans vs. deceiving computers: How cognitive biases of attackers can be helped/changed by computers?
* Deception for offense: Social engineering, phishing, disinformation, dark patterns in UI/UX and other manipulation techniques
* Adapting offensive deceptive techniques to defense
* Interdisciplinary research methods to improve active defense via attackers' human factors

__Note that we exclude the concepts of preemptive attacks, hacking back and counter-attacks.__
The authors of accepted research papers can choose whether they want their papers to be part of the official proceedings.

## Workshop Format
<!-- 
One author of each accepted research paper or proposal is expected to present the work at the workshop. The format is expected to include traditional conference-style presentations followed by roundtable discussion and feedback. Interactive and engaging presentations are welcomed. Following notification to authors, more information will be provided regarding speaking times and other details.
* _Research Papers_: Accepted research papers will be made available on the workshop web site, but the workshop will have no official proceedings.
* _Research Proposals_: Research proposals are intended for PC review. Only titles, abstracts, and funding sources for these talks will be posted on the workshop web site, and we will request that the authors provide these in both text and PDF format.
