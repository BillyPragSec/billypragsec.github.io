## Workshop on Active Defense and Deception

The AD&D workshop aims at promoting Active Defense as an effective extra security layer, with the goals of moving the research forward and of encouraging its adoption by the industry. In particular, as the 'assume breach' mindset becomes the norm, Active Defenses are becoming one of the most promising solutions.

Traditionally, information security distinguishes the roles of the attacker and the defender. The attacker is active: he gathers information, explores the system, finds vulnerabilities, and  executes exploits; while the defender is passive: he collects and monitors the system logs and tries to detect malicious behavior via attack signatures. The attacker knows very well who the
victim is, while the defender often has limited information about the attackers, their methods, and their real motivations. This imbalance makes more difficult to defend computer systems and helps the attackers to remain undetected for long periods of time (today it takes on average 40+ days to reveal an attack [*]).

Active defense can mitigate these problems by finding ways to proactively engage with the attackers during the early stages of the attack lifecycle. This can be implemented in various ways, such as by mutating/diversifying the system (i.e, Moving Target Defense), adapting to the attacks in real time (Adaptive defense), and by introducing runtime defenses (e.g., RASP).
One important aspect of active defense is deception, where the defender can place enticing traps around the system, mimic vulnerabilities, or obfuscate system elements to deceive, confuse, and mislead possible attackers. Since some of the most destructive attacks (such as supply-chain attacks and phishing campaigns) are composed of multiple stages, active defense
has the potential to detect such attacks with rather simple techniques.
Despite the high accuracy promised by these techniques, active defense has not been widely adopted in information security. Possible reasons include the fact that it requires a multidisciplinary approach and a good understanding of the human aspect and the psychology of the attackers, that its effectiveness is hard to quantify, and that it may be difficult to integrate active defense at different layers in the target system.

Thus, this workshop aims to bring together researchers from a variety of fields such as psychology and cognitive science, with experts in different forms of deception for defense, but also in offense techniques (such as social engineering and disinformation). In particular, we aim to address the following questions:
How can we evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of active defense?
What is the impact of attackers’ deception awareness?
How can we impact the attackers’ decision making process to make them waste more resources?
Is it possible to reuse offensive deception techniques against attackers?
How can we optimize the enticement of deceptive elements without making them too obvious?
How can deceptive elements be updated to ensure long-term effectiveness?
What are the myths vs. real world experiences on active defense?
How can we move forward to increase the adoption of active defense?

## Organization

### General chairs:
* Merve Sahin, _SAP Security Research_
* Nick Nikiforakis, _Stony Brook University_
* Timothy Barron, _Yale University_ 

### Publicity chair: 
* Billy Tsouvalas, _Stony Brook University_

## Call for contributions
For the first edition of this workshop, we plan to have mostly invited talks. However, we still open a call for contributions in
the form of research proposals, extended abstract, or opinion papers. Your contribution should be at most 3-pages long in
double-column format. Submissions accepted at the workshop will not be published in the conference proceedings.

“Organization committee ?? will evaluate the submissions based on relevancy,  impact, novelty, and the potential to spark discussion? of the idea. Proposals need not include proof-of-concept or preliminary results. Proposals that would benefit from, or even require, interdisciplinary collaboration are encouraged.”


### Topics of Interest
The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
* All types of active defense methods: moving target defense, dynamic and runtime defenses, and deception use cases
* Attacker engagement in different stages of attack lifecycle
* Measuring the overhead of active defense
* Experiment designs and frameworks to measure the effectiveness of active defense
* Feedback from real-world uses of active defense, canaries, honeypots: What worked and what did not?
* Automation of active defense and deception
* Monitoring, alerting, containment, and deceptive response strategies
* Ensuring longevity and continuation of deception
* Attackers' reasoning, decision making and behavior patterns
* Cognitive approaches that attackers can get prepared against
* Deceiving humans vs. deceiving computers: How cognitive biases of attackers can be helped/changed by computer?
* Deception for offense: Social engineering, phishing, disinformation, dark patterns in UI/UX and other manipulation
techniques
* Adapting the offensive deceptive techniques to defense
* Interdisciplinary research methods to improve active defense via attackers' human factors


Note that we exclude the concepts of preemptive attacks, hacking back and counter-attacks.

## Submission types and format
Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf), preferably following the IEEE conference proceedings templates.

* _Research Papers_:
    Submitted papers must be no longer than five pages, including all figures. References and appendices will not count towards this limit, but reviewers are not required to read appendices.

* _Research Proposals_:
    Submitted proposals must be no longer than a single page in double column format, including all figures. References and appendices will not count towards this limit, but reviewers are not required to read appendices.

## Submission site:
“Submissions must be provided via <https://conpro21.ccs.neu.edu/> and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline. During the submission process, you will be asked to supply information regarding potential conflicts of interest of the submission's authors with program committee members. Submissions should not indicate authors' names or affiliations (but may reference past work without indicating common authorship).”

## Workshop Format
One author of each accepted research paper or proposal is expected to present the work at the workshop. The format is expected to include traditional conference-style presentations followed by roundtable discussion and feedback. Interactive and engaging presentations are welcomed. Following notification to authors, more information will be provided regarding speaking times and other details.
Research Papers: Accepted research papers will be made available on the workshop web site, but the workshop will have no official proceedings.
Research Proposals: Research proposals are intended for PC review. Only titles, abstracts, and funding sources for these talks will be posted on the workshop web site, and we will request that the authors provide these in both text and PDF format.



## Important Dates

* Paper submission: 
* Acceptance notification: 
* Workshop date: June 10, 2022
