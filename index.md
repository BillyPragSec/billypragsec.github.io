## Workshop Format

One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the workshop. The format will be traditional conference-style research presentations with questions from the audience. Interactive and engaging presentations are welcomed. Following notification to authors, more information will be provided regarding speaking times and other details.

The accepted papers will be made available on the workshop website and the workshop will have *official proceedings*. Publication in the proceedings is not mandatory and authors can choose to have their papers excluded from the official proceedings by selecting "No proceedings" during submission in HotCRP.


## Financial Support

MADWeb will provide limited financial support to a selected number of speakers and attendees to pay workshop registration fees. Priority will be given to authors of accepted papers, students working in relevant areas of research and coming from under-represented institutions, attendees who have clear financial need, attendees from diverse backgrounds and from under-represented minority communities.

Please add any relevant information under "Request financial support for attending the workshop?" to your submission in HotCRP, or contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or special requests.
